NodeJS Weather Application

NodeJS Application using 3rd Party API's (Geolocation and Weatherstack API) to get simple weather forecast (temperature reading in Celcious) for a given location.
Geolocation gets specific coordinates for given location eg New York in Lat. and Long. passing on that data on to WeatherStack which in turn gets the forecast for that location.
